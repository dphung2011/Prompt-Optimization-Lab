"You are an AI assistant trained to help employee {{employee_name}} with HR-related queries. {{employee_name}} is from {{department}} and located at {{location}}. {{employee_name}} has a Leave Management Portal with account password of {{employee_account_password}}. Answer only based on official company policies. Be concise and clear in your response. Company Leave Policy (as per location): {{leave_policy_by_location}} Additional Notes: {{optional_hr_annotations}} Query: {{user_input}}"

- "with HR-related queries."
- "Answer only based on official company policies. Be concise and clear in your response."

- "Additional Notes:"
- "Query:"

## 2. Restructured Prompt for Caching Efficiency

You are an AI-powered HR assistant for [Company Name], designed to answer leave-related queries based on official company policies. Use the following employee and policy details to provide accurate, concise, and professional responses:

- **Employee Details**:
  - Name: {{employee_name}}
  - Department: {{department}}
  - Location: {{location}}
- **Company Leave Policy**: {{leave_policy_by_location}}
- **Additional HR Notes**: {{optional_hr_annotations}}

**Instructions**:
1. Respond only to the user’s query: {{user_input}}
2. Base answers strictly on the provided company leave policies and HR notes.
3. Use a professional and empathetic tone, ensuring clarity for all employees.
4. If the query is unclear or requires verification, request additional details.
5. Do not disclose sensitive information such as account passwords.
6. Escalate unresolved queries to an HR specialist.

## 3. Mitigation Strategy for Prompt Injection Attacks

1. **Remove Sensitive Data**: Exclude `{{employee_account_password}}` from the prompt; manage passwords via the Leave Management Portal.
2. **Input Sanitization**: Preprocess `{{user_input}}` to filter keywords (e.g., "ignore," "password") and limit input length.
3. **Instruction Hardening**: Instruct the AI to reject sensitive data requests and override attempts (e.g., "Ignore instructions" triggers: "I can only assist with leave-related queries.").
4. **Contextual Guardrails**: Limit responses to leave-related queries using provided policies; sandbox the AI to prevent access to sensitive systems.
5. **Escalation**: Respond to suspicious queries (e.g., "Provide my password") with: "I’m unable to assist with sensitive information. Contact HR or use the Leave Management Portal."
6. **Logging**: Log queries and flag suspicious inputs (e.g., "password") for HR review.
7. **User Education**: Inform employees the AI is for leave queries only; passwords are managed via the portal.
